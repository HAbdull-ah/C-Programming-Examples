# C Programming and Unix Activities

This document combines C programming exercises with Unix activities to reinforce the concepts of both disciplines. Each week focuses on integrating Unix tasks with C programs to provide hands-on experience in both areas.

## Week 1-2: Introduction to C and Unix Basics
- **C**: Introduction to basic syntax, printing a message, and compiling a C program.
- **Unix**: Learn basic commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, and `mkdir`.
- **Combined Activity**: 
  - Write a "Hello, World" C program, then navigate the directory to locate, compile, and run it using Unix commands (`gcc`, `./a.out`).

## Week 3: Control Structures and File Permissions
- **C**: Use control structures (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops.
- **Unix**: Learn about file permissions (`chmod`, `chown`) and manage ownership.
- **Combined Activity**:
  - Write a program that checks if a file exists and has specific permissions. Use Unix commands to change those permissions.

## Week 4: Functions and Shell Scripting
- **C**: Create simple functions and understand function calls.
- **Unix**: Introduction to shell scripting (writing and running simple scripts).
- **Combined Activity**:
  - Write a C function to take input and print output, then create a shell script to compile and run the C program automatically.

## Week 5: Arrays, Loops, and Piping
- **C**: Use arrays and nested loops.
- **Unix**: Learn piping and redirection (`|`, `>`, `>>`).
- **Combined Activity**:
  - Write a C program that generates a list of numbers, then use a Unix pipe to redirect the programâ€™s output to a file.

## Week 6: Review and Scripting Automation
- **C**: Review previous topics and reinforce loops and arrays.
- **Unix**: Use shell scripting to automate tasks.
- **Combined Activity**:
  - Automate the compilation and execution of multiple C programs using a shell script.

## Week 7: Pointers and File Searching
- **C**: Understand pointers and pointer arithmetic.
- **Unix**: Use `find` and `grep` commands to search files.
- **Combined Activity**:
  - Write a C program that reads from a file and uses pointers to manipulate the data. Use `grep` in Unix to search for specific patterns in the file.

## Week 8: Structs and Process Management
- **C**: Use structs to handle complex data.
- **Unix**: Learn process management commands (`ps`, `top`, `kill`).
- **Combined Activity**:
  - Create a C program that simulates processes using structs. Use Unix process management commands to monitor system processes while running the C program.

## Week 9: Midterm Exam
- **C**: Include functions, arrays, and pointers.
- **Unix**: Test knowledge of basic commands, scripting, and file permissions.
- **Combined Activity**:
  - Combine C programming and Unix scripting into a project where students write and automate programs using both concepts.

## Week 10: Dynamic Memory and Cron Jobs
- **C**: Use dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`).
- **Unix**: Learn to schedule tasks using cron.
- **Combined Activity**:
  - Write a C program that allocates memory dynamically and schedules its execution using a cron job.

## Week 11: File I/O and Networking
- **C**: Learn file input/output operations.
- **Unix**: Learn networking commands like `ping`, `netstat`.
- **Combined Activity**:
  - Write a C program that logs network information into a file, and use Unix networking commands to verify network status.

## Week 12: 2D Arrays, Compression, and Archiving
- **C**: Use 2D arrays and nested loops.
- **Unix**: Learn file compression (`tar`, `gzip`).
- **Combined Activity**:
  - Write a C program that processes a 2D array and archives the output file using Unix compression commands.

## Week 13: Macros and System Monitoring
- **C**: Use macros and preprocessor directives.
- **Unix**: Monitor system performance using `top`, `ps`.
- **Combined Activity**:
  - Write a C program that uses macros for conditional compilation and monitor its execution using Unix system monitoring tools.

## Week 14-16: Final Project and Exam
- **C**: Combine all learned concepts into a final project.
- **Unix**: Automate, monitor, and manage the project using Unix commands.
- **Combined Activity**:
  - Write a complex C program (e.g., a mini file system or calculator), automate its execution with scripts, and use Unix commands to manage resources and processes.
